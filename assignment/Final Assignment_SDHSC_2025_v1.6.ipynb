Focus on what they might find interesting in your writeup. Make your visualisation understandable and well signposted.\n",

    "- do your work in this notebook, details of submission will be in learn\n",
    "- only use techniques you learned on this course (no Pandas!) and write your code by yourself.\n",
    "- written part of mini-reports will be short, about 2 paragraphs of text (200 words +/- 10%) explaining what you saw in the data, what question you identified, and how you answered it with code."
